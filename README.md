To start, I chose a game class that is responsible for everything about the game and loads it. All game objects are composed of objects because "we prefer composition over inheritance". I also use the factory pattern for the easy creation of enemies. The level consists of game objects with tile components and uses a hexagonal coordinate system (which I probably shouldn't have done because it is rather uninuitive). For the explanation of the controls and the switching of gamemodes I use imgui. You can play with keyboard and controller for which I used Xinput. For the sound I use the Simple SDL2 Audio which runs on a separate thread. The health and points displays use the [https://github.com/VictorGhys/Qbert/blob/main/Qbert/QbertComponent.cpp](observer patern). And the input uses the command pattern.
