To start, I chose a game class that is responsible for everything about the game and loads it. All game objects are composed of [components](https://github.com/VictorGhys/Qbert/blob/main/Minigin/Component.h) because "we prefer composition over inheritance". I also use the [factory pattern](https://github.com/VictorGhys/Qbert/blob/main/Qbert/EnemyFactory.cpp) for the easy creation of enemies. The level consists of game objects with tile components and uses a hexagonal coordinate system (which I probably shouldn't have done because it is rather uninuitive). For the explanation of the controls and the switching of gamemodes I use imgui. You can play with keyboard and controller for which I used Xinput. For the [sound](https://github.com/VictorGhys/Qbert/blob/main/Minigin/SDL2SoundSystem.cpp) I use the Simple SDL2 Audio which runs on a separate thread. The health and points displays use the [observer patern](https://github.com/VictorGhys/Qbert/blob/main/Qbert/QbertComponent.cpp). And the input uses the [command pattern](https://github.com/VictorGhys/Qbert/blob/main/Qbert/QbertCommands.h).
